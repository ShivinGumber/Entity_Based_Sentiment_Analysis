And this is all while the iPhone SE 3 takes care of the sub- ₹ 40, 000 space. Bloomberg' s Mark Gurman says in one of his latest reports that the iPhone SE 2020 could see a massive price drop after the March 8 Spring event. $T$ will announce the iPhone SE 3 as its most affordable 5G smartphone and drop the prices of the iPhone SE 4G variant at the same time.
Apple

The sole reason behind this is $T$ wanting to make the iPhone more accessible so as to rope in more customers to try its other services. The iPhone SE 2020 has seen mega price cuts throughout its two- year lifecycle. Originally launched at a starting price of Rs. 43, 000, several e- commerce sales over the years have seen the iPhone SE prices go as low as ₹ 26, 000.
Apple

At the moment, the base 64GB variant of the iPhone SE is selling at Rs. 30, 000. The last time an iPhone was available in India for this low as the original iPhone SE. After two years of sales, the tiny iPhone SE often sold for as low as Rs. 15, 000 during Flipkart sales. With the current iPhone SE, Apple would want to take on the budget Android smartphones. Even though the iPhone SE 2020 lacks some of the modern features, such as an edge- to- edge display, a big battery and fast charging, it is still one of the fastest smartphones you can buy at its price. Meanwhile, the iPhone SE 3 itself is expected to have a sub-$ 300 price tag. The updates iPhone SE 3 is likely to get a chip upgrade– from the ageing A13 to Apple' s latest A15 Bionic. Note that the A15 chip powers the iPhone 13 series at the moment, and supports 5G networks. The rest of the phone is said to remain unchanged from the iPhone SE 2020. The feature allows users to check traffic situation on roads with colour coding signaling the intensity of traffic movement. The live traffic feature on $T$ makes use of anonymous location data collected from Android smartphones to reflect the condition of traffic movement on roads. But several experts say that this data could be potentially affected in the time of war and especially in the face of an invading force.

Jai Bhim movie review: Suriya headlines a powerful film about fighting for the oppressed T. J Gnanavel' s Jai Bhim will go down as one of the most important films in Suriya' s career. I use the word important because it' s one of those rare occasions where the star hasn' t flexed his heroism and let his co- stars steal the spotlight.

When $T$ gets convicted in a false case of robbery, and later goes missing in police custody; his wife seeks the help of advocate Chandru( Suriya) for justice.

One of the highlights of Jai Bhim are the courtroom sequences which have been shot in the most realistic fashion. $T$ as the lone woman standing against system that is rigged against her, is one of the best casting choices in recent times in Tamil cinema.
