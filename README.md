# Entity-Based-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the automated process of tagging data according to their sentiment, such as positive, negative, and neutral. Sentiment analysis allows companies to analyze data at scale, detect insights and automate processes. 

A specific domain of sentiment analysis is Entity Based Sentiment Analysis where the machine is able to understand sentiment associated with a particular entity. For example - 

"Actor R Madhavan is a proud father after his son Vedaant Madhavan won a gold medal in swimming at the Danish Open 2022 in Copenhagen." The sentiment associated with the entity 'Vedaant Madhavan' is 'Positive' here.

"Brand New Royal Enfield Explodes Like a Bomb Hours After Delivery" The sentiment associated with the entity 'Royal Enfield' is 'Negative' here.

The Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis is a similar task with the difference that the sentiments of aspects are extracted instead of entities.
